# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: 08.12.2024**

Close Google Tabs Extension ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how your information is handled when you use our Chrome Extension.

## Data Collection

We do not collect, store, or process any personal data or browsing activity from users. Our extension operates entirely within your local device and does not transmit any data outside your browser.

## How Our Extension Works

Our extension scans the domains of your currently open browser tabs to identify matches based on a predefined rule (e.g., specific domains). If a domain matches, the extension closes the relevant tab automatically. All operations occur locally on your device.

- No Data Transmission: No data about your browsing activity, including the domains of open tabs, is collected, transmitted, or stored.
- No Third-Party Services: This extension does not interact with or use any external servers or third-party services.
Permissions
To perform its intended function, the extension requires permission to access tab information. This permission is strictly used to read the domain of open tabs and take action if a match is found. It is not used for any other purpose.

## Cookies and Local Storage

This extension does not use cookies or local storage to save any information about you, your browsing activity, or your settings.

## Security

As no data is collected or transmitted, there is no risk of unauthorized access, data leaks, or other privacy-related issues.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page, with the "Effective Date" updated accordingly. We encourage you to review this privacy policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your privacy.
